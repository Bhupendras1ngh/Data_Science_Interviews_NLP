# Data_Science_Interviews_NLP

## Project StatementÂ 

Recently I had a random question that is there a dataset containing a variety of data science interview questions & answers? For now, I didn't find any so I decided to create on my own! ðŸ¥³

Hence I spent several days to gather over 300 data science interview questions & answers and finally built a dataset large enough to explore.Â 
To be honest, at the beginning, I thought it would be really difficult to cover the majority of types of data science questions. So I decided to gather only the non-coding ones.Â 

Surprisingly, I found that, after reading hundreds of data science questions from websites such asÂ 
- Simplilearn
- Springboard
- Towards Data Science
- Edureka
- Analytics VidhyaÂ 
- Other Github repos

A conclusion is that there are not as many different interview questions as I expected. After a careful data selection & categorization, I completed a NLP project on the dataset. Hopefully, you will enjoy reading it!
